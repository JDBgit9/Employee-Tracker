# Employee-Tracker

## Description
This is an interface that makes it easier for the developer like myself to view and interact with information stored in datbases.  This interface is what is called a Content Management System and my assigment was to build and design a soltion for a managing company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.   This was a challenging project but it felt good when it was working in proper order. We have just started with the back end development and and how it relates to the front end.  I had to creat a datbase on Dbeaver to hold the data and connect it to the interface to poerly run.   I am pleased with the final product as eveything is in working order."
